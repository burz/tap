# taps - An OpenGL based game engine

Author: Anthony Burzillo

******

Currently taps only works on linux (Only tested on Ubuntu; OSX compiles but does not display anything).

A particularly enlightening example is found in programs/source/color_cube.cpp -- to run this program:

```shell
$ make color_cube
$ ./programs/color_cube
```
You can move the cube with the arrow as well as the 'o' and 'l' keys. Furthermore, the cube can be
rotated about the origin with the  'd', 'f', 'g', 'c', 'v', and 'b' keys. The camera's position can be
changed with the spacebar, and you may quit by pressing ESC.
